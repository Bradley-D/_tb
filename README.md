=== _tb - Twitter Bootstrap WordPress Theme ===

_tb is my starter theme based on Twitter Bootstrap 3 and Underscores.

The idea behind this theme is that it is a starter theme, so try and keep the code you add separated from the core. Styles can be added at the bottom of style.css, custom WordPress functions can be added to /includes/custom-functions.php and if you are building a WooCommerce site you can also add to /includes/tb-wc-functions.php if you want to keep WooCommerce functions out of your custom-functions.php file.
