_tb - Twitter Bootstrap WordPress Theme (Sass)
===

Hi. I'm a starter theme called _tb. I have been carefully crafted using Automattic's _s (underscores) theme and sprinkled with Twitter Bootstrap (Sass). Please use me for good and not evil.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Search for `'_tb'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.
2. Search for `_tb_` to capture all the function names.
3. Search for `Text Domain: _tb` in style.css.
4. Search for <code>&nbsp;_tb</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.
5. Search for `_tb-` to capture prefixed handles.

OR

* Search for: `'_tb'` and replace with: `'megatherium'`
* Search for: `_tb_` and replace with: `megatherium_`
* Search for: `Text Domain: _tb` and replace with: `Text Domain: megatherium` in style.css.
* Search for: <code>&nbsp;_tb</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Megatherium</code>
* Search for: `_tb-` and replace with: `megatherium-`

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css` and the links in `footer.php` with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
